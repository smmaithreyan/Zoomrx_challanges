I have committed 2 scripts - logrot.sh & logrotate.sh
logrotate.sh --- Uses linux Utility logrotate to perform rotation of log files based on time or size
logrot.sh --- Have executed this script by creating inifinite loop for test scenario...This can be modified based on need and It will not run automatically by default
